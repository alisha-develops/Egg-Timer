# 🥚 Egg Timer

This is my Egg Timer project—made for anyone who wants to boil the perfect egg without overthinking it.

# ⏱ How it works:

- If your water is already boiling, it takes about 15 minutes to fully boil an egg.
- As the timer runs, the egg image updates to show you it’s almost cooked, and when it’s done, you’ll see the final stage image, so no guessing!

# Timing
- Soft-boiled: ~4–6 minutes
- Medium: ~7–9 minutes
- Hard-boiled: ~10–12 minutes
- Extra firm: up to 15–20 minutes

# Features
* ⏲️ Simple countdown timer
* 🥚 Stage-based egg images to track progress
* 🎯 Minimal design, maximum simplicity

# How to Use
 - Open the app.
 - Click “Start” and let it run.
 - Watch the egg image change as it cooks.
    Done! Grab your perfectly boiled egg. 🥳
